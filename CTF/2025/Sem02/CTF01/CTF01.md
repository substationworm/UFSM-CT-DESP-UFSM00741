- 🛠 **Procedures:**
    1. 🦈 Open the `CTF01.pcapng` file using Wireshark.
    2. 🦈 Examine the packet capture carefully and address the challenges presented below.
- ❓ **Challenges:**
    1. 🏁 What is the total number of packets captured? `UFSM00741{xxxx}`
    2. 🏁 What is the SHA1 hash value of the capture file? `UFSM00741{xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx}`
    3. 🏁 What are the capture file comments? `UFSM00741{Xxxxx-Xxxxx-Xxxxx}`
    4. 🏁 How many frames are marked as response not found? `UFSM00741{xx}`
    5. 🏁 Identify the flag in the comment of frame no. 10521. `UFSM00741{Xxxx-Xxxxx}`
    6. 🏁 Which host attempted, on six occasions, to identify who has `172.30.5.5`? `UFSM00741{xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx}`
    7. 🏁 Within the captured traffic, a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) request can be identified. What is the uniform resource identifier (URI) of the request? `UFSM00741{http://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx}`
    8. 🏁 What is the user-agent associated with the HTTP request? `UFSM00741{xxxx xxxxxx}`
    9. 🏁 Which other website (server name) was accessed within the capture, although the traffic is encrypted? `UFSM00741{xxx.xxxx.xxx}`
    10. 🏁 In the third frame captured of connection finish, what is its time to live (TTL)? `UFSM00741{xx}`
    11. 🏁 In the third frame captured of connection finish, what is the coordinated universal time (UTC) timestamp of arrival? `UFSM00741{Xxx x, xxxx xx:xx:xx.xxxxxxxxx}`
    12. 🏁 Starting from frame 563, it is possible to deduce that `172.30.1.3` performed which type of `nmap` scan? `UFSM00741{Xxxx}`
    13. 🏁 Starting from frame 111, it is possible to infer that `172.30.1.3` executed which type of `nmap` scan? `UFSM00741{XXX Xxxxxxx Xxxx}`
    14. 🏁 Locate the flag that is hidden within the frames of this Wireshark file. *No hint provided*, `UFSM00741{Xxxxxx-Xxxxxxxxxx-Xxxxx}`
    15. 🏁 **Bonus**. An additional hidden flag is present. *No hint provided*, `UFSM00741{Xxxxx-Xxxxx}`
