## üìù Task 01 - Operational Technologies and Industrial Control Systems

- üìã **Instructions:**
    1. Develop a scientific and technical text introducing the following topics:
        - ‚úçÔ∏è **Operational Technologies (OT):** Fundamental concepts, core functions, and their role in critical infrastructure systems.
        - ‚úçÔ∏è **Industrial Control Systems (ICS):** Key components and architectural models.
        - ‚úçÔ∏è **Examples of Applications in Electric Power Systems:** Use cases of OT-ICS environments in electric power systems.
    2. The text may include figures or tables, when appropriate, to support the technical discussion.
    3. All external information must be properly cited in accordance with the [2021 Thesis and Dissertation Manual of the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM)](http://repositorio.ufsm.br/handle/1/24203).
    4. The content must not exceed four pages, with a fifth page reserved exclusively for the bibliographic references.

## üìù Task 02 - Inquiry-Based Learning Questions

- üïµÔ∏è **Question 01.** What does the *S* in SCADA stand for?
- üïµÔ∏è **Question 02.** What is the primary function of a human-machine interface (HMI) in an OT-ICS environment?
    1. To store historical data logs for compliance purposes.
    2. To physically control industrial equipment using mechanical levers.
    3. To provide a graphical interface for operators to monitor and control industrial processes.
    4. To serve as a backup power supply for ICS devices.
- üïµÔ∏è **Question 03.** What is the main function of a programmable logic controller (PLC) in an OT-ICS environment?
    1. To collect and transmit data from network devices to a control center.
    2. To control industrial processes by executing logic-based operations.
    3. To provide long-term data storage for industrial process analyses.
    4. To provide a time source to sensitive devices in a process environment.
- üïµÔ∏è **Question 04.** What is a typical use of a remote terminal unit (RTU) in OT-ICS systems?
    1. To store operator credentials for secure system access.
    2. To provide remote access for management and configuration purposes to equipment.
    3. To provide a terminal window for operator interactive access.
    4. To collect data from sensors and transmit it to a SCADA system over long distances.
- üïµÔ∏è **Question 05.** Which PLC programming language resembles traditional electrical relay layouts in control cabinets?
- üïµÔ∏è **Question 06.** Which PLC programming language is most similar to a high-level language such as C?
- üïµÔ∏è **Question 07.** Which PLC programming language has the appearance of interconnected elements similar to a circuit design?
- üïµÔ∏è **Question 08.** What does a rung represent in Ladder Logic programming for PLCs?
    1. A mathematical operation.
    2. A control logic instruction.
    3. A timer function.
    4. A sequence of interconnected function blocks.
- üïµÔ∏è **Question 09.** What does *scan cycle time* refer to in the context of PLCs?
    1. The amount of time the PLC takes to communicate with external devices.
    2. The time it takes for the PLC to execute one complete cycle of reading inputs, processing logic, and updating outputs.
    3. The speed of the processor inside the PLC.
    4. The field bus communication speed.
- üïµÔ∏è **Question 10.** Which protocol would most likely be captured via Wireshark when an industrial data historian communicates with a HMI?
    1. SSH.
    2. OPC.
    3. SNMP.
    4. DNP3.
- üïµÔ∏è **Question 11.**  Based on details from a cyberattack against ICS that occurred in January 2024, which protocol was abused to cause disruption in the heating systems of several apartment buildings? *Hint: The malware name had a symbolic reference to ice cream.*
    1. PROFINET.
    2. DNP3.
    3. Modbus TCP.
    4. OPC UA.
- üïµÔ∏è **Question 12.** According to a Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) article co-authored by Michael Assante, how many cyber incidents in nuclear facilities were publicly disclosed between 2010 and 2016?
- üïµÔ∏è **Question 13.**  In an interview conducted by Andy Greenberg with Michael Assante, what was the approximate data size in kilobytes required to blow up a diesel generator?
- üïµÔ∏è **Question 14.** In the well-known Stuxnet attack against an Iranian nuclear facility, how did the malware impact centrifuge operations?
    1. Hijacked operator controls, preventing manual intervention.
    2. Caused minor data corruption in the historian logs to mask the attack.
    3. Overloaded the facility's power supply, causing widespread equipment failure.
    4. Sped up and slowed down centrifuge speeds to cause mechanical failure.
