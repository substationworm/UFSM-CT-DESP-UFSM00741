## üìù Exercise 01 - Automatic Fish Reservoir Monitoring

- üë∑ **Control Logic Description:**
    - The automatic monitoring system for the fish reservoir uses level sensors and pumps to maintain adequate water levels.
    - The reservoir is equipped with four water level sensors, specified as follows:
        1. Lower level sensor: `SNS_LOW = %I0.0`.
        2. Intermediate low level sensor: `SNS_INT_LOW = %I0.1`.
        3. Intermediate high level sensor: `SNS_INT_HIGH = %I0.2`.
        4. Upper level sensor: `SNS_HIGH = %I0.3`.
    - The reservoir features three pumping systems for water level control:
        1. Water inlet pump: `INLET = %Q0.0`.
        2. Lower drainage pump: `PUMP_BOTTOM = %Q0.1`.
        3. Upper drainage pump: `PUMP_TOP = %Q0.2`.
    - Operating conditions and control actions:
        1. Normal water level:
            - ‚úÖ Active sensors: `SNS_LOW` and `SNS_INT_LOW`.
            - üíß Action: `PUMP_BOTTOM` and `PUMP_TOP` remain deactivated.
        2. Below acceptable level:
            - ‚≠ï Active sensors: None.
            - üíß Actions:
                - The pump `INLET` should be activated to increase the water level.
                - üî¥ The alarm (`ALARM`, red light) should blink to indicate a critical situation.
        3. Above normal level:
            - ‚úÖ Active sensors: `SNS_LOW`, `SNS_INT_LOW`, and `SNS_INT_HIGH`.
            - üíß Action: The pump `PUMP_BOTTOM` should be activated to drain excess water.
        4. Critical level (above permitted):
            - ‚úÖ Active sensors: All sensors (`SNS_LOW`, `SNS_INT_LOW`, `SNS_INT_HIGH`, `SNS_HIGH`).
            - üíß Actions:
                - Pumps `PUMP_BOTTOM` and `PUMP_TOP` should operate simultaneously to expedite drainage.
                - üî¥ The alarm should blink to indicate an emergency state.
    - The alarm is manually deactivated by the operator by pressing the reset button (`RESET = %Q0.4`).
    - The alarm is triggered by two alternating timers, ensuring an intermittent signal.
- üè∑Ô∏è **Additional Requirements:** 
    - üü¢ Start push-button: `START = %I0.4`.
    - ‚ö´ Stop push-button: `STOP = %I0.5`.
    - üîµ Reset push-button: `RESET = %I0.6`.
    - üî¥ Visual alarm: `ALARM = %Q0.3`.
- üìã **Instructions:**
    1. Develop the control logic using the [Twido Suite by Schneider Electric](https://www.se.com/br/pt/faqs/FA278356/).
    2. Create a human-machine interface (HMI) using [Vijeo Designer Basic by Schneider Electric](https://www.se.com/us/en/download/document/VijeoDesignerBasic/).
    3. Implement the control logic on the programmable logic controller (PLC) [Twido TWDLCDE40DRF by Schneider Electric](https://www.se.com/us/en/product/TWDLCDE40DRF/compact-base-controller-twido-24vdc-supply-compact-24-inputs-with-24vdc-16-output-relays-transparent-ready/).
    4. Establish communication between the HMI and the PLC, and perform simulation tests to verify proper system operation.
