## üìç Objectives

- üìå Develop theoretical knowledge and gain practical experience with networks and protocols used in operational technologies (OT).
- üìå Understand OT concepts and their integration into information technology (IT) systems.
- üìå Provide knowledge on industrial network architectures for industrial control systems (ICS).

## üìñ Course Outline

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to ICS.
    - Programmable logic controllers (PLC).
    - Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems.
    - Human-machine interfaces (HMI).
    - Distributed control systems (DCS).
    - Safety instrumented systems (SIS).

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Communication protocols for ICS.
    - Typical IT sytems: HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMTP, FTP, SNMP, DHCP, etc.
    - Fieldbus and fieldbus management (Purdue levels 0-1): Modbus, CIP (DeviceNET, ControlNET, and CompoNET), PROFINET, PROFIBUS, etc.
    - Site SCADA (Purdue levels 2-3): OPC and building automation protocols (BACnet, Modbus, Zigbee, etc.).
    - Regional SCADA (Purdue levels 2-3): Modbus, DNP, IEC 60870, IEC 61850 (GOOSE, SV, and MMS), etc.
- 4Ô∏è‚É£ Network topologies and services for ICS.
- 5Ô∏è‚É£ Configuration, analysis, and monitoring of industrial networks for OT.

## üë®üèª‚Äçüè´ Teaching Methodologies

- Theoretical classes primarily follow an expository and interactive approach, incorporating pedagogical mediation techniques and project-based learning (PjBL) strategies. This methodology aims to enhance student engagement and active participation during lectures.
    - Additionally, complementary strategies are employed, including small-group guided studies, tutorial-based teaching-learning approaches, and gamified pedagogical practices to reinforce theoretical concepts.
- Practical sessions are categorized into two main approaches:
    - **Simulations and virtualized environment studies:** These sessions leverage computational tools such as [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) for packet analysis, scripting, and virtual labs for testing and investigating communication protocols for ICS. Examples include software-based implementations of PLCs using [OpenPLC](https://autonomylogic.com/docs/openplc-overview/) and [Factory I/O](https://factoryio.com/). This course prioritizes the use of free and open-source software (FOSS).
    - **Laboratory experiments:** Aimed at replicating real industrial automation architectures, laboratory practices involve the use of available electro-electronic components, measurement instruments, and prototypes. These activities are conducted at the Laboratory for Analysis and Protection of Electrical Systems (*Laborat√≥rio de An√°lise e Prote√ß√£o de Sistemas El√©tricos* [LAPES]) or the Electrical and Electronics Laboratory ([*Laborat√≥rio de El√©trica e Eletr√¥nica* [NUPEDEE]](https://nupedee.ufsm.br/s/#main)).
- Throughout the course, Moodle is used for sharing educational resources, YouTube serves as a repository for recorded lectures, and Google Meet/Jitsi Meet provides a platform for video conferencing.

## ‚úÖ Grading Criteria

- The final course grade will be determined based on students' weighted performance in the following categories:
    - ‚ùó Homeworks: 50%.
    - ‚ùó Projects: 30%.
    - ‚ùó Capture the flag (CTF) test: 20%.
- Each graded activity will be evaluated on a 100-point scale. Homework assignments may include open-ended questions, multiple-choice questions, and true-or-false statements. Additionally, they may incorporate practical activities, particularly simulations and studies conducted in virtualized environments, structured as CTF-style challenges.
- Throughout the course, at least one project is required, with an ideal goal of completing two: one based on simulated industrial environments and another involving laboratory experiments. Finally, at the end of the semester, an optional CTF test will be administered, covering the entire course content.
- To pass the course, students must achieve a minimum score of 70 points. Those who do not meet this requirement will have the opportunity to take an final exam, which will assess all course topics.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Attendance Policy

- To pass the course, students must also maintain a minimum attendance of 75%. Students who exceed 25% in absences will not be permitted to take the assessments.
- According to the [academic guide of the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM)](https://www.ufsm.br/app/uploads/sites/342/2019/06/Guia_UFSM_2019_Finalizado_9MB-1.pdf), attendance will be monitored, and the class registry will be updated weekly. Class participation is permitted only for students officially enrolled in the course. Absence excusal is strictly prohibited, except in cases covered by [Law No. 4.375/64](https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/l4375.htm) and [Decree-Law No. 715/69](https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/1965-1988/del0715.htm).
